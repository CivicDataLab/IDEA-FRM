# Satellite and Weather Data
This salient data type informs the factors and extent of floods but can help in developing early warning systems using predictive modelling.

## Data Sources
Satellite and weather data were primarily sourced from the following public resources:
1. Satellite data on flood inundation: [BHUVAN - Disaster services](https://bhuvan-app1.nrsc.gov.in/disaster/disaster.php) & [Dartmouth Flood Observatory](https://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Archives/ArchiveNotes.html)
2. Lithology Map: [USGS](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr97470C)
3. River Discharge Data: [Central Water Commission](https://ffs.india-water.gov.in/main/hydrograph)
4. Precipitation data: [ECMWF ERA-5 Satellite](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_LAND_MONTHLY?hl=en)
5. Distance from river: [India - Water Resources Information System](https://indiawris.gov.in/wris/#/)
6. Major rivers: [India - Water Resources Information System](https://indiawris.gov.in/wris/#/)
7. Drainage Density: [India - Water Resources Information System](https://indiawris.gov.in/wris/#/)
8. Land use data: [Copernicus Global Land Service](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lc)
