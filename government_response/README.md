# Government Resposne
Government response before, during and after disaster is principal while proposing any solution. We are looking through the lens of such expenditure, as seen in [government procurement data](assamtenders.gov.in), budget data and relief distributed (as reported in FRIMS).

## Data Sources
Government response is captured from the following resources:
1. Assam Budget 2022: [Open Budgets India](https://assam2022.openbudgetsindia.org/en/)
2. Relief and Rescue operations: Flood Reporting and Information Management System [(FRIMS)](http://www.asdma.gov.in/reports.html)
3. Public Procurement data: [Assam Tenders](assamtenders.gov.in)
