## Directory Tree:
1. [ML_InputData](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/IDEA-FRM/tree/main/ML_InputData): Prepared input data for modelling and analysis.
2. [Pre_Modelling](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/IDEA-FRM/tree/main/Pre-Modelling): Codes on Data preparation, Multi-collinearity analysis and Dimensionality Reduction.
3. [FRIMS](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/IDEA-FRM/tree/main/FRIMS): Various damages due to Floods (population affected, roads damaged, houses damaged etc.,) are collected and organised on the FRIMS portal in the form of PDFs. These PDFs are scraped, cleaned and organised in excel sheets to enable temporal analysis.
