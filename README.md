# Intelligent Data Ecosystem for Assam - Flood Response & Management (IDEA-FRM)
IDEA-FRM combines different flood-related datasets such as the Satelite data, socioeconomic data, data on past damages and the fiscal data onto a single point, for decision-makers, experts, enterprises, academicians and interested citizens to understand Assam floods holistically and co-create impactful solutions.

## Installation Guidelines:
To run the SEM Model on your system, do the following steps:
1. Clone this repository.`git clone https://github.com/CivicDataLab/IDEA-FRM.git`
2. Create your own virtual environment if needed.
3. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.

## Directory Tree:
1. [FRIMS](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/IDEA-FRM/tree/main/FRIMS): Various damages due to Floods (population affected, roads damaged, houses damaged etc.,) are collected and organised on the FRIMS portal in the form of PDFs. These PDFs are scraped, cleaned and organised in excel sheets to enable temporal analysis.
2. [Maps](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/IDEA-FRM/tree/main/Maps): Administrative boundaries of Assam.
3. [Procurement Data](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/IDEA-FRM/tree/main/ProcurementData): Floods related tenders issued by the Assam Government are geocoded and organised here.
4. [SEM](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/IDEA-FRM/tree/main/SEM): Codes and model specifications related to Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)
